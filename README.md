### Project Overview

I did this application with Eduweb course guided by Adam Romanski - React Course from Scratch.

### Technical Overview

1. ReactJS
2. React Router
3. Sass
4. Conditional Rendering
5. Context API

### Personal Growth

I can translate this course to few hours of intensive knowledge compendium. I got to refresh my knowledge but mostly author introduced me to new concepts like conditional rendering or Context API. Even though it was step by step course and didn't leave much for a imagination, it left some easier tasks to listener which upon completion were pretty satisfying. There is one task I set for myself after this course was over. Graphically the project looks nice, but it lacks in functionality. Any interesting thing that you might want to save, will not be there simply because there is no database implemented. That's why I need to add MongoDB to this setup
